function G = geodist(X,Y,R)
% Compute the geodesic distances between pairs of points X
% and Y on the surface of sphere(s) or radius R.
%
% Usage:
% G = geodist(X,Y,R)
%
% Inputs:
% X and Y = Euclidean coordinates for the set of points.
%           For P points in the D-dimensional space,
%           X and Y have size P by D, P > 0, D > 1.
% R       = Radius of the sphere(s) on which surface the distances
%           are measured. R can be a scalar, in which case the same
%           radius is used for all pairs of points, or can be a
%           vector size P, in which case, each pair of points will
%           be considered as lying on the surface of a sphere with a
%           different radius.
%           In either case, the set of P points are not assumed to be
%           all in the surface of the same sphere.

G = alpha .* R;  % simple, isn't it...!
